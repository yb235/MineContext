## 👋🏻 What is MineContext

MineContext is a proactive context-aware AI partner. By utilizing screenshots and content comprehension (with future support for multi-source multimodal information including documents, images, videos, code, and external application data), it can see and understand the user's digital world context. Based on an underlying contextual engineering framework, it actively delivers high-quality information such as insights, daily/weekly summaries, to-do lists, and activity records.

![feature.gif](src/feature.gif)

## 🚀 Key Features

MineContext focuses on five key features: effortless collection, intelligent resurfacing, and proactive delivery.

1. 📥 Effortless Collection
   Capable of gathering and processing massive amounts of context. Designed storage management enables extensive collection without adding mental burden.
2. 🚀 Proactive Delivery
   Delivers key information and insights proactively in daily use. It extracts summarized content from your context—such as daily/weekly summaries, tips, and todos—and pushes them directly to your homepage.
3. 💡 Intelligent Resurfacing
   Surfaces relevant and useful context intelligently during creation. Ensures assisted creativity without overwhelming you with information.
4. 🛡️ Privacy-First
    All data is stored locally, ensuring your privacy and security.
5. 🎯 Context Engineering Architecture
   Supports the complete lifecycle of multimodal, multi-source data—from capture, processing, and storage to management, retrieval, and consumption—enabling the generation of six types of intelligent context.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Click [Github Latest Release](https://github.com/volcengine/MineContext/releases) to Download

![Download APP](src/Download-App.gif)

### 2. Disable the quarantine attribute

Enter the following command in the terminal to disable the quarantine attribute before running the application.

```
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/MineContext.app"
```
![Quarantine](src/Quarantine.gif)

### 3. Enter Your API-Key

After the application loads（initial run may require installation of some backend environments, which may take a few minutes）, follow the instructions to enter your API-Key. We currently support Doubao and OpenAI, with more platforms and local Ollama models to be added in the future.

![Enter API-Key](src/Enter-API-Key.gif)

### 4. Start Recording

Enter 【Screen Monitor】 to enable the system permissions for screen sharing. After completing the setup, you need to restart the application for the changes to take effect.
![Enable-Permissions](src/Enable-Permissions.gif)

After restarting the application, please first set your screen sharing area in 【Settings】, then click [Start Recording] to begin taking screenshots.
![Screen-Settings](src/Screen-Settings.gif)

### 5. Forget it

After starting the recording, your context will gradually be collected. It will take some time to generate value. So, forget about it and focus on other tasks with peace of mind. MineContext will generate to-dos, prompts, summaries, and activities for you in the background. Of course, you can also engage in proactive Q&A through [Chat with AI].



## 💎 The Philosophy Behind the Name

The naming of MineContext also reflects the team's ingenuity. It signifies both "my context" and "mining context." It draws inspiration from the core philosophy of Minecraft—openness, creativity, and exploration.

If vast amounts of context are like scattered "blocks," then MineContext provides a "world" where you can freely build, combine, and create. Users can reimagine and create new content based on the collected massive context and generate high-quality information.

## 🚀 Backend Usage

### Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast and reliable package management:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/volcengine/MineContext.git
cd MineContext

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies (automatically creates virtual environment)
uv sync
```

### Configuration

1. **Basic Configuration** (`config/config.yaml`):

```yaml
server:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8765
  debug: false

embedding_model:
  provider: doubao  # options: openai, doubao
  api_key: your-api-key
  model: doubao-embedding-large-text-240915

vlm_model:
  provider: doubao  # options: openai, doubao
  api_key: your-api-key
  model: doubao-seed-1-6-flash-250828

capture:
  enabled: true
  screenshot:
    enabled: true # enable screenshot capture
    capture_interval: 5  # capture interval in seconds
```

2. **Prompt Templates** (`config/prompts_*.yaml`):
   - `prompts_en.yaml`: English prompt templates
   - `prompts_zh.yaml`: Chinese prompt templates

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start with default configuration
uv run opencontext start

# Start with custom config
uv run opencontext start --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Start with custom port (useful for avoiding conflicts)
uv run opencontext start --port 8000
```

**Available Options:**
- `--config`: Path to configuration file
- `--host`: Host address (default: from config or `localhost`)
- `--port`: Port number (default: from config or `8000`)

**Priority**: Command-line arguments > Config file > Default values

Alternatively, you can activate the virtual environment manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
opencontext start --port 8000
```
